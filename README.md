# Rborist.CRAN

This archive mirrors the source code for the Rborist package in a form amenable to CRAN requirements.  In particular, it is intended to facilitate construction of the package using familiar R-language utilities, such as devtools.  Rborist.CRAN is built from the Rborist archive by script.  Pull requests are possible, but contributors are requested to try to work with the Rborist archive instead.
